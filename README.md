# FAN Spotlight 
 Our final project for CS 100 at UC Riverside. Our group is consisted of three team members and we collaborating together to design a movie library software. 
## Authors: 
 * Frances Isabelle Cristobal(https://github.com/frxncrxs)
 * Alejandra Avitia-Davila(https://github.com/alejandraavitia03)
 * Neda Karemi(https://github.com/nedurland)


## Project Description
  Our goal is to create a movie library/feed manager that allows users to have a feed with recommended movies based off genre and reviews. We will also be incorporating a library system which will allow them to keep track of movies they've watched and want to watch. Our software will allow users to leave ratings and reviews for others to see. We will be using an easy to use GI for our software.
### Why this is our choice:
 The reason we have chosen to create a movie library/feed software is because we are huge fans of films and are currently unsatisfied with different applications available to find movies based on ratings and genre. By creating this software we are hoping to make a much more user friendly and simple experience for ourselves and other movie fanatics who are having trouble picking a movie.
### How we will carry on:
* Language and Tools used:
	* C++ - The language we will be using.

* Input: 
	Like Pinterest or We Heart It, users will be prompted to give input:
	* Favorite:
		* Movies
		* TV Shows 
	* Personalized
		* Reviews 
		* Ratings
* Output: 
	With the given input we will return the user a customized feed for them and display other users reviews and ratings. 
* Design patterns we will be using:
	* Strategy Pattern: This design pattern was picked because it allow us to have something that does one thing and implement them in different ways. For example we have two interfaces, Sort and Recommend that will be called differently. Recommend will allow us to recommend by Genre, Director and Actors. The sorting algorithms will sort the recommended list by ratings and release date.

	* Composite Pattern:

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
