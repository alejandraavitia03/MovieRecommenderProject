# FAN Spotlight 
 Our final project for CS 100 at UC Riverside. Our group is consisted of three team members and we collaborating together to design a movie library software. 
## Authors: 
 * Frances Isabelle Cristobal(https://github.com/frxncrxs)
 * Alejandra Avitia-Davila(https://github.com/alejandraavitia03)
 * Neda Karemi(https://github.com/nedurland)


## Project Description
  Our goal is to create a movie library/feed manager that allows users to have a feed with recommended movies based off genre and reviews. We will also be incorporating a library system which will allow them to keep track of movies they've watched and want to watch. Our software will allow users to leave ratings and reviews for others to see. We will be using an easy to use GI for our software.
### Why this is our choice:
 The reason we have chosen to create a movie library/feed software is because we are huge fans of films and are currently unsatisfied with different applications available to find movies based on ratings and genre. By creating this software we are hoping to make a much more user friendly and simple experience for ourselves and other movie fanatics who are having trouble picking a movie.
### How we will carry on:
* Language and Tools used:
	* C++ - The language we will be using.

* Input: 
	Like Pinterest or We Heart It, users will be prompted to give input:
	* Favorite:
		* Movies
		* TV Shows 
	* Personalized
		* Reviews 
		* Ratings
* Output: 
	With the given input we will return the user a customized feed for them and display other users reviews and ratings. 
* Design patterns we will be using:
	* Strategy Pattern: This design pattern was picked because it allow us to have something that does one thing and implement them in different ways. For example we have two interfaces, Sort and Recommend that will be called differently. Recommend will allow us to recommend by Genre, Director and Actors. The sorting algorithms will sort the recommended list by ratings and release date.

	* Composite Pattern:  
		

 > ## Phase II
 > * Set up your GitHub project board as a Kanban board for the project. It should have columns that map roughly to 
 >   * Backlog, TODO, In progress, In testing, Done
 >   * You can change these or add more if you'd like, but we should be able to identify at least these.

 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member. Place these in the `Backlog` column
 > 
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Create smaller development tasks as issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `Backlog` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team, taking you until your first meeting with the TA
## Class Diagram
In our UML folder.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in with the TA (during lab hours or office hours). Your entire team must be present. 
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II
 > * In the meeting with your TA you will discuss: 
 >   - How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 >   - Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 >   - Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 >   - What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
